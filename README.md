42 London Discovery Week :HTML &amp; CSS Showcase

Brief Summary
During my coding week at 42’s Discovery Piscine, I learned the essentials of bash and building web pages with HTML and CSS. Our final assignment (“Rush”) challenged me to set up a simple multi-page site: a responsive index page linking to two separate resume (“CV”) pages. I practiced HTML structure, semantic elements, creating navigation, using Bootstrap for responsive designs, and styling with custom CSS.
